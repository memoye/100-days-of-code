# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I began working on [Erudite Ticketing System](https://github.com/memoye/erudite-ticketing-system)

**Thoughts:** I'm working on the nav bar. I like to take my time to make as many right decisions as possible while styling so I don't run into problems with the reponsiveness later. I seem to be indecisive about how I want the nav to look exactly, I'm sure I'll get better ideas tomorrow. I think I need to spend some more time planning the design.

### Day 1: October 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Built a skeleton loader (loading indicator) for my event component using React. It'll conditionally render when fetching event data.

**Thoughts:** This is the first loader I'm building. It may not be perfect, but it works üòÅ. I intentionally decided not to use any sort of UI library or anything just to exercise my CSS a little. Apparently, skeleton loaders not hard at all, just needs a bit of patience and imagine.

### Day 2: October 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I made some progress on the Event card component.

**Thoughts:** It's not always easy coming up with the designs all on one's own as a developer, at least not for me... yet. So this is taking more time than it should. The power went out üò™. I hope I get to finish the component tomorrow though

**Link to work:** _I did not push today beacuase my laptop died before I had the chance to. I'll push everything first thing tomorrow though_

### Day 2: October 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the event card UI. I also created the Hero section. Now I just have to figure out how the rest of the landing page will look like

### Day 3: October 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the event card component and I also created a simple hero section today. The landing page is starting to come together üôÇ

**Thoughts:** I'm just taking things step by step - going from the known to the unknown.

### Day 4: October 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I took a break from _Erudite_ today. I just went ahead and solved a Codewars challenge.

**Thoughts:** The challenge tested my logical reasoning. It took a little while, but I figured it out eventually.

[Here's the challenge](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a1ebe0d46d843454100004c/train/javascript) and [this is my solution](https://www.codewars.com/kata/reviews/5a1f395d2d2f855d29003622/groups/652d4e9bb975a80001696cb6)

### Day 5: October 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I tried out typescript today. Building a todo list with react and firebase.

**Thoughts:** TypeScript is... interesting

### Day 6: October 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started working on [FLIXForte](https://github.com/memoye/flixforte): a movie database website using ReactJS, Tailwind, and the TMDb API. I've set up the router and started on the header, and it's already looking fun! üíª

**Thoughts:** I think going forward, I'll just keep using tailwind. It's so much more satisfying for me.
