# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Today I began working on [Erudite Ticketing System](https://github.com/memoye/erudite-ticketing-system)

**Thoughts:** I'm working on the nav bar. I like to take my time to make as many right decisions as possible while styling so I don't run into problems with the reponsiveness later. I seem to be indecisive about how I want the nav to look exactly, I'm sure I'll get better ideas tomorrow. I think I need to spend some more time planning the design.

### Day 1: October 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Built a skeleton loader (loading indicator) for my event component using React. It'll conditionally render when fetching event data.

**Thoughts:** This is the first loader I'm using. It may not be perfect, but it works üòÅ. I intentionally decided not to use any sort of UI library or anything just to exercise my CSS a little. Apparently, skeleton loaders not hard at all, just needs a bit of patience and imagine.
